# 📊 RFM Analysis & Customer Segmentation in eCommerce

## 📌 Overview
This project applies **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** on eCommerce sales data to identify customer behavior and create actionable customer segments.  
It also explores predictive modeling using a **Decision Tree Classifier** to forecast customer segments for future data.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Algorithms: RFM Scoring, Decision Tree Classifier

---

## 🔑 Key Steps
- ✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (dates, missing values, duplicates)  
- ✅ RFM Metric Calculation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)  
- ✅ RFM Scoring & Customer Segmentation (Champions, Loyal, At Risk, etc.)  
- ✅ Data Visualization of customer segments  
- ✅ Predictive Modeling using Decision Tree  

---

## 📊 Insights
- Segmented customers into meaningful groups  
- Identified high-value customers ("Champions") and customers at churn risk  
- Built a Decision Tree model for predicting customer segments
